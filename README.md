# This is a Markdown blog website
## Created with javaScript, ejs, Bootstrap on front-end and Node.js, Express, mongoDB on back-end

At first glance it is just a regular website where you can add articles about anything but th special thing here is that if you click Edit you can see articles are actually written using markdown so we can change this markdown to have anything we want and it will automaticallybeing converted to HTML
